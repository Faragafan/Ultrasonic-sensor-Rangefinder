# Ultrasonic-sensor-Rangefinder
This repository contains Arduino and MATLAB code for a capable ultrasonic sensor and a servo motor to perform range-finding tasks
The system constains two push buttons, used to control the operations and the modes of the system.
Also contains 4 LED lights that indicates the status of the system.

HARDWARE:
To build this, an Arduino UNO R3 has been used alongside a HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor, and a SG90 servo motor/
Pins used for the sensor and the motor are included in the Arduino code.
